# Small War

A game project with C++ from scratch to learn C++.





## FAQ

#### Why did you do this project?

During my 3rd year project at Epitech, I designed a small game under Unity. The development was not very conclusive due to a bad organization. However I always wanted to perfect this project which is very important to me.


#### Why not re-use Unity then?

First of all, I am very interested in network programming and I want to learn C++ during my studies.

Moreover, we are trained in my school by projects and not a plethora of theoretical courses. So what better way to learn than through a game?

Finally, I enjoyed my experience on Unity and would like to return to it after this project. I don't want to discover another game engine, but to learn and improve on Unity.
